# Safety-Siren
In today's society, personal safety is perhaps the most vital immediate concern. Our app SafetySiren is a crowd-sourced safety threat reporting web app that circumvents this issue and may save lives!

Our app essentially displays a map to users, allowing users who are signed in to add safety alerts by simply inputting a location and having it appear dynamically on all users' maps when they use the app.
For the front-end, we utilized Vue.js along with Bootstrap, along with the Firebase Authentication and Google Maps APIs. We used Firebase Authentication to ensure that users would not be able to post unnecessary alerts without signing in (to avoid fake alerts), and we used the Google Maps API to dynamically display and update alerts for all users to view.
